# SUNYPOLY
code written as part of my classes at SUNY Polytechnic Institute.  I'm working on a degree - MS Network and Computer Security: Cybersecurity.  

https://sunypoly.edu/academics/majors-and-programs/ms-network-computer-security.html

The focus is cybersecurity - so this is mostly code samples with a few actual projects tossed in.  90% of what you'll find here is purely for info gathering or dirty exploits.
